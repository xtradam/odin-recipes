    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 c. lukewarm water</li>
      <li>2 tsp. granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 3/4 c. all-purpose flour, plus more for surface</li>
      <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 c. full fat greek yogurt</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil, for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, combine lukewarm water and
        sugar. Sprinkle yeast on top and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Add yeast mixture and
        yogurt and use a rubber spatula to combine. Once a shaggy dough starts
        to form, dump onto a clean work surface and knead with your hands until
        a smooth dough forms. Transfer to a clean bowl and cover with a kitchen
        towel. Let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a floured surface, divide dough into 8 equal pieces. Roll each out
        into a 7‚Äù circle. Keep dough covered with a clean kitchen towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat enough oil to lightly
        coat the bottom of the pan. Working one at a time, cook dough until
        blistered and dark golden in spots, about 3 minutes per side. Adjust
        heat and add more oil as needed.
      </li>
    </ol>
